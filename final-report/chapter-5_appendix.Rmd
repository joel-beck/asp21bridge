# Appendix {-}

The following paragraphs contain additional information about the **simulation studies** that were covered in chapter \@ref(simulations).




### Section \@ref(corr): Correlated Predictor Variables {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The simulation design was chosen in the following way:

- The design matrix $\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_2 & \mathbf{x}_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is simulated from a three dimensional normal distribution $\mathcal{N}_{3} \left( \boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{\Sigma} \right)$ with mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 & 2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and covariance matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \rho & \rho \\ \rho & 3 & \rho \\ \rho & \rho & 5 \end{pmatrix}$.
Hence, the dependence among the regressors is fully determined by the parameter $\rho$.

- The design matrix $\mathbf{Z} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{z}_1 & \mathbf{z}_2 \end{pmatrix}$ consists of linear combinations of the regressors $\mathbf{x}_1$ up to $\mathbf{x}_3$, more specifically $\mathbf{ z}_1 = 0.8 \cdot \mathbf{x}_1 + 0.2 \cdot \mathbf{x}_2$ and $\mathbf{ z}_2 = \mathbf{x}_2 - 0.5 \cdot \mathbf{x}_3$.
In both design matrices intercept columns are added for estimation purposes.

- The true coefficient vectors are given by $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0 & \beta_1 & \beta_2 & \beta_3 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & -1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma_0 & \gamma_1 & \gamma_2 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$.

- The outcome variable $\mathbf{y}$ is generated according to the correctly specified location-scale model $y_i \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathcal{N}_{} \left( \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta}, \exp \left( \mathbf{z}_i^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} \right)^2 \right)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ with sample size $n = 50$.
Before data generation all columns in $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{ Z}$ are standardized, i.e. mean-centered around $0$ and scaled to unit variance.

- Three different values were chosen for $\rho \in \left\{ 0, -0.5, 0.9 \right\}$ to compare the 'nice' case of uncorrelated predictors with the performance for negative and positive dependence.
For each covariance structure the three models `mcmc_ridge()`, `mcmc()` and `lmls()` are fitted to the standardized covariates, where each Posterior Mean estimate from both of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers is based on $10.000$ samples.



### Section \@ref(n): Sample Size {.unlisted .unnumbered}





### Section \@ref(redundant): Redundant Covariates {.unlisted .unnumbered}

We again state the conditions that the simulation study is based on:

-   The design matrix $\mathbf{ X} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{1}_{n} & \mathbf{x}_1 & \cdots & \mathbf{x}_{20} \end{pmatrix}$ consists of one intercept column plus $10$ *pairs* of successive regressors, starting with the pair $( \mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2)$.
    Each pair $( \mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_{i+1})$ for $i \in \left\{ 1, 3, \ldots, 19 \right\}$ is (independently from all remaining pairs) drawn from a bivariate normal distribution with mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and correlation matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0.9 \\ 0.9 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

- The design matrix $\mathbf{ Z} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{1}_{n} & \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_3 \end{pmatrix}$ is of minor interest in this case and consists of an intercept column plus two uncorrelated columns chosen from $\mathbf{X}$.

- The true coefficients of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ are determined by the pattern $\beta_i = 0$, if $i$ is even and $\beta_i = 1$, if $i$ is odd.
Thus, all covariates with even subscript are redundant, whereas those with odd subscript contribute to $\mathbf{y}$. 
The true $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$, again of minor interest here, is given by $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^T$.

- The outcome variable $\mathbf{y}$ is generated according to the correctly specified location-scale model $y_i \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathcal{N}_{} \left( \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta}, \exp \left( \mathbf{z}_i^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} \right)^2 \right)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$, where the covariates are used on their original scale.

- The sample size $n = 50$ is deliberately chosen small compared to the number of regressors.
Before fitting each of the three models, all columns of $\mathbf{X}$ except the intercept column is standardized to zero mean and unit variance.
Both of the Bayesian models generate $10.000$ values for each coefficient. 






### Section \@ref(outcome): Challenging the Model Assumptions {.unlisted .unnumbered}

The data for this simulation study is generated by the following conventions:

- The design matrix $\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{1}_{n} & \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_2 & \mathbf{x}_3 & \mathbf{x}_4 \end{pmatrix}$ contains four independently sampled regressor variables plus one intercept column:
    + $\mathbf{x}_1 \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathcal{N}_{} \left( 5, 16 \right)$,
    + $\mathbf{x}_2 \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathrm{Exp}(5)$,
    + $\mathbf{x}_3 \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathcal{U}_{} \left( \left[ -2, \; 12 \right] \right)$,
    + $\mathbf{x}_4 \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathrm{Ber}(0.3)$.

- The design matrix $\mathbf{Z} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{1}_{n} & \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_2 & \mathbf{z}_3 \end{pmatrix}$ contains the additional regressor variable $\mathbf{z}_3 \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} t_{10}$, which is independently sampled from all other columns.

- The true coefficient vectors are given by $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0 & \beta_1 & \beta_2 & \beta_3 & \beta_4 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -10 & -5 & -3 & -1 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma_0 & \gamma_1 & \gamma_2 & \gamma_3 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 5 & 10 \end{pmatrix}^T$.

- Three different specifications for the outcome distribution were chosen:
    + $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}_{} \left( \mu, \sigma^2 \right)$,
    + $y_i \sim \mu + \left(\sigma \cdot \sqrt{ \frac{ 3}{ 5}}\right) T$, where $T \sim t_{5}$,
    + $y_i \sim \mu + \sigma \cdot U$, where $U \sim \mathcal{U}_{} \left( \left[ 0, \; 1 \right] \right)$.
In all cases, the outcome vectors are generated with the covariates on their original (unstandardized) scale.
    
- In order to isolate the impact of the different shapes of the three probability distributions from the effect of varying moment structures, the mean $\mu = \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta}$ and the variance $\sigma^2 = \exp \left( \mathbf{z}_i^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} \right)^2$ are held constant across the models.

- All three models `mcmc_ridge()`, `mcmc()` and `lmls()` are fitted with standardized covariates.
The sample size is set to $n = 50$ and the result of both Bayesian samplers are based on $10.000$ simulations.




### Section \@ref(hyper): Hyperparameters {.unlisted .unnumbered}





### Section \@ref(hyper-penalty): Hyperparameters {.unlisted .unnumbered}

This simulation study is conducted in the following way:

- The column vectors of the design matrices $\mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{x}_1 & \mathbf{x}_2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\mathbf{Z} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbf{z}_1 & \mathbf{z}_2 \end{pmatrix}$ are independently drawn from normal distributions with variance $\sigma^2 = 1$ and varying means $\mu \in (1, 2, 5, 3)$. 
Then both design matrices are standardized and intercept columns are added. 

- The true coefficient vectors are given by $\boldsymbol{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} \beta_0 & \beta_1 & \beta_2 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 8 & 2 \end{pmatrix}^T$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma} = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma_0 & \gamma_1 & \gamma_2 \end{pmatrix}^T = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 3 \end{pmatrix}^T$.

- The outcome variable $\mathbf{y}$ is generated based on the standardized covariates according to the correctly specified location-scale model $y_i \stackrel{ iid}{ \sim} \mathcal{N}_{} \left( \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta}, \exp \left( \mathbf{z}_i^T \boldsymbol{\gamma} \right)^2 \right)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$ with sample size $n = 50$.

- The pairs of hyperparameters $(a_\tau, b_\tau)$ and $(a_\xi, b_\xi)$ take values on a grid, which is constructed by all combinations of the sequence $\left( \frac{ 1}{ 16}, \frac{ 1}{ 8}, \frac{ 1}{ 4}, \frac{ 1}{ 2}, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 \right)$.
While one pair is varied, the other pair is fixed on the values $(1, 1)$.

- The `mcmc_ridge()` function does not use the `lmls()` function as basis in this case, but rather use the standardized data directly as input.
The number of simulations `num_sim` is chosen as $1000$ and the starting values `beta_start` and `gamma_start` are set to $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$, respectively.
